    <string name="ghunna_1">\tFor every noon and meem mushaddad, i.e. for every noon and meem that have a shaddah, one must sound a ghunnah.
                            \n\tRecall a ghunnah is the sound made entirely by the nose [nasal passage]. It is almost like a hum and completes the sound of the noon or meem. Ghunnah is directly translated to “nasalisation” and this should not be longer than two counts. i.e. similar to the time it takes to say the words: “one – two”.
                            \n\tIt is the simplest rule, because you just need to check, does the noon/meem have a shaddah on top? If so, sound a ghunnah.
    </string>
    <string name="ikhfa_1">Literal meaning: To conceal something</string>
    <string name="ikhfa_2">The rule: If any of the 15 letters of Ikhfaa’ come after Noon As-Sakinah or Tanween the word will be read between Ith’har and Idghaam with the existence of Ghunna, and the duration will be of two Harakah.</string>
    <string name="ikhfa_3">ف ق ك ث ت خ ذ د ذ ش س ض ص ظ ط</string>
    <string name="ikhfa_4" />
    <string name="ikhfa_5" />
    <string name="idgham_1">Literal meaning: To merge something into something else</string>
    <string name="idgham_3">If any of these letters come after Nûn As-Sakinah or Tanween it is read with Ghunna.</string>
    <string name="idgham_2">It has four letters (ي , ن , م , و (يَنْمُو.</string>
    <string name="idgham_4" />
    <string name="idgham_5" />
    <string name="idgham_without_ghunna_1">It has two letters:</string>
    <string name="idgham_without_ghunna_2">"ر ل "</string>
    <string name="idgham_without_ghunna_3">If any of these two letters precede Nûn As-Sakinah or Tanween it will be read without Ghunna.</string>
    <string name="iqlab_1">After every Noon Saakinah or Tanween, if the letter baa (ب) follows, the sound must be flipped [i.e. changed] to the sound of the letter meem (م). </string>
    <string name="iqlab_2">The lips should not be entirely pressed together, to allow for the meem to come through the nasal passage as well. The mouth should be prepared to say the baa after sounding through the meem. So the above, min b‘ad is sounds like mimm b‘ad when read. What ever you do, take this piece of advice and do not get mixed up between the full shaped meem (م) drawn above letters to indicate iqlaab, and the cut meem (مـ) to indicated a compulsory stop. Refer to the resources link below. Iqlaab must be sounded for two counts, i.e. the time it takes to say the words, “one – two”.</string>
    <string name="qalqala_1">
        \tQalqalah: sound articulation and echo. In essence the word means shaking/disturbance. In Tajweed, it means to disturb the letter that has sukoon, i.e. that is saakin, but without any corresponding movement of the mouth and jaw that is associated with voweled letters (i.e. letters that have fat-ha, dammah, or kasra). Qalqalah “shakes” to “echo” the letter without taking up the preceding or succeeding letter’s diacritic.
        \n\tTo explain:
        \n\tThere are five letters in the Arabic alphabet that apply to Qalqalah. These five letters are:
    </string>
    <string name="qalqala_2">" ج ق ط ب د"</string>
    <string name="qalqala_3">\tTo feel the importance of Qalqalah, try saying (أط), how about (أق) you’ll find one of two things happen. Either the back end of your tongue gets stuck and it’s difficult to loosen it and breathe, or your tongue will naturally slip and the back of your mouth is open again. It is this “slipping” that Qalqalah is based on. Disturbing the letter without moving your jaw or mouth. Try it for the rest of the letters, (أد) and (أج) and (أب). Imagine trying to say the word,\n\t
أبْناء
\n\tIf there was no “slipping”/”shaking”/”echoing” of the letter baa (بْ) then how hard would it be to say the noon (ن) straight away with your lips still pressed together? Doing Qalqalah will cause your lips to “slip” a bit i.e. open up a tiny bit without adding a diacritic to the baa, to make it easy to pronounce the noon.</string>
    <string name="no_need_to_read_1">If the questioning hamzah enters a word that starts with a hamzatul wasl of type participle, the hamzatul wasl is dropped and swapped for an alif. This does not change whether the laam in the original “Al-” is merged or pronounced based on whether it’s a laam shamseeyah or qamareeyah. Note, that when this occurs, it is called Al-Madd Al-Farq.</string>
    <string name="no_need_to_read_2">If the hamzatul wasl is preceded by the word min (مِنْ), then the silent noon is voweled with a fat-ha. We take this rule for granted, because the Quranic scripture does this for us already, we see it all the time and probably don’t even know about it.\n
        If the hamzatul wasl is preceded by the pluralising silent waaw that is preceded by a fat-ha, or if the hamzatul wasl is preceded by the pluralising silent meem, then the meem/waaw are voweled with a dammah. As with above, the Quranic scripture does this for us. An example of each:\n
        In all other cases, not covered in the first two circumstances, any word that ends with any form of sukoon that precedes a word starting with a hamzatul wasl of any form, must have the sukoon voweled with a kasra.</string>

    <string name="event1_info">
        \t“For if the reward yielded by good works at other times are tenfold, in the month of Rajab they are more than a hundredfold, in Sha‘ban they exceed three hundredfold, and in Ramadan they reach a thousand fold, while on Fridays in Ramadan they reach thousands and on the Night of Power may reach thirty thousand. (The Rays, p.491)\n\n
        \tMuslim spirits are covered with a different atmosphere in this phase of time, which is known as “Shuhur’u-Salasa” – Three Holy Months – in religious literature; because, divine mercy is at its merit within these months. If merits and religious services are rewarded tenfold in other times, they are rewarded more and more in the months of Rajab, Sha’ban and Ramadan.

    <string name="event2_name">Isra and Mi\'raj</string>
    <string name="event2_hijri_date">26 Rajab,</string>
    <string name="event2_info">
        \tThe Isra’ Mi’raj — the Night Journey and Ascension of the Prophet Muhammad — is a significant observance for Muslims around the world. Those adhering to the Islamic faith will attest that it was during this momentous night that the Prophet Muhammad embarked on a miraculous journey atop a brilliant white-winged beast called Al Buraq (from the Arabic bariq, meaning lightning).\n\n
        \tThe night journey (Isra’) of the Prophet began from the Masjid al-Haram in Makkah to its destination the Masjid al-Aqsa in Jerusalem. Along the way, the Prophet made a number of stops as ordered by Gabriel, including Madinah, Mount Sinai, Bethlehem and the grave of Moses. Upon reaching the Masjid al-Aqsa, Prophet Muhammad performed his night prayer before ascending to the seven heavens (Mi’raj). \n\n
        \tAccompanied by the archangel Gabriel soaring alongside, the ascension transported Prophet Muhammad beyond the seven heavens to reach the Throne of God where he was permitted an audience with the Creator Himself. \n\n
        \tIt is considered desirable for Muslims to take advantage of the eve of the holiday (and of the holiday itself) by performing more voluntary night prayers, reciting the Holy Qur’an as well as making supplications. Muslims are also advised to engage the day by performing righteousness to parents, strengthening kinships and committing to acts of charity.

    <string name="event3_name">Shab-e-Barat</string>
    <string name="event3_hijri_date">14 Shabaan,</string>
    <string name="event3_info">
        \tShab e barat day is known as Bara\'at Night, The Night of Fortune and Forgiveness. Shab e-Barat is a holiday observed on the 14th night of Sha\'aban, the eighth month in the Islamic calendar. Shab e-Barat which takes place on the full moon is dependent on the sighting of the previous new moon signifying the start of the month of Sha\'aban. In Islam, Shab-e-Barat means the night of forgiveness, or Day of Atonement. It is considered to be the night when God forgives sinners.\n\n
        \tThe history of this festival dates backs to the time when the twelfth Imam of the Shia Muslims named Muhammad al-Mahdi was born. The night of Shab e barat is celebrated as his birthday.\n\n
        \tOn the other hand, Sunni Muslim community believes that on this day only, God saved the ark of Noah from the flood. This is why the people across the globe celebrate shab e barat.\n\n
        \tOn shab e barat, people pray to Allah and visit the graves of their near and dear ones to offer prayers and light candles. Some Muslims do a daylong fast while spending the night seeking mercy for the sins committed by them. Muslims stay awake in the night, reciting the Quran and praying after the return from the graveyards where they prayed for their departed relatives and Muslim congregation.\n\n
        \tMuslims believe on Shab-e Barat, God writes their destinies for the year to come, on the basis of their past actions. Therefore, the night is spent in asking for God’s mercy for any misdemeanour. Shab e barat is celebrated by Shia Muslims with joyous displays of fireworks.

    <string name="event4_name">The beginning of Ramadan</string>
    <string name="event4_hijri_date">1 Ramadan,</string>
    <string name="event4_info">The beginning of Ramadan</string>
    \tA prominent Islamic scholar has very aptly described Ramadan in the following words: “Fasting
    is not just the state of remaining hungry and thirsty. Its nature and effect can only be
    discovered by experience. The human makeup is such that the less food is consumed the greater is
    the purification of the soul and the development of the powers of inner vision. God’s purpose is
    that you should reduce one kind of food (physical) and increase the other kind (spiritual). The
    person fasting must remember that the aim is not simply to remain hungry; he should be engrossed
    in the remembrance of God so as to attain severance from worldly desires. Those who truly fast
    for the sake of attaining to God, and not merely as a custom, should be absorbed in the praise
    and glorification of God, and in meditating upon His Unity.”
    <string name="event5_name">Laylat-al-Qadr</string>
    <string name="event5_hijri_date">27 Ramadan,</string>
    <string name="event5_info">
        \tThe Night of Power – also referred to as Laylat-al-Qadr – is considered to be the Holiest night in the Islamic calendar. This was the night when the first verses of the Holy Qur’an were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), by Angel Jibrail. This night falls within the last 10 days of Ramadan, and although the exact date is unknown, it is widely believed to be the 27th day of the Holy month.\n\n
        \tOn this night, a single good deed brings the blessings of 1,000 months. Just some of the good deeds that we can carry out on the Holiest of nights include dedicating the day to worship to increase your taqwa, reciting the Holy Qur’an to familiarise yourself with its teachings and giving to those most in need, thus fulfilling one of the Five Pillars of Islam. In fact, giving charity on Laylat-al-Qadr means that rewards for such a deed will come back manifold.\n\n
        \tThere are plenty of things one can do on this auspicious night to maximise our blessings and reward. We have detailed some of these below:\n\n
        \tRecite the Holy Qur’an\n
        \tDuring the month of Ramadan and over the course of the year, many of us tend to recite the Holy Qur’an without knowing what it is we are actually reading. Take some time out to translate the meaning of the Holy Qur’an on this night; it is, after all, the night the very first verses of the guidance were revealed - ask yourself one simple question: would you read an English book from cover to cover if you did not understand what you were reading?\n\n
        \tSupplications (Dua)\n
        \tIt is said that you may ask Allah SWT for whatever you wish for on this night (legitimate desires, of course) but in doing so, do not forget to make as much Dua as possible for others and seek repentance as much as possible to your Lord for your sins on this night.\n\n
        \tUnite\n
        \tRamadan is intended to bring peace and unity to Islam so ensure you spend as much time as possible praying and worshipping with your loved ones. Visit the Mosque with your family and friends, have your suhoor and iftar with them and pray alongside each other, too.\n\n
        \tDedicate Time\n
        \tIn this day and age, we take numerous days off from our work and commitments to attend occasions and events that hold much importance to us. This night is, by far, infinitely more important than any worldly commitment we could have, so ensure you book the day off to worship, seek repentance and thank your Lord for the privilege itself.\n\n
        \tPerform I’tikaaf\n
        \tThe Holy Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) used to spend the final ten days of this Holy month in I’tikaaf at the Masjid. I’tikaaf is the act of performing continuous prayer and Dhikr (devotional prayers/remembrance of Allah SWT) at the Masjid for a prolonged period of time, without leaving.\n\n
        \tIbaadah (Worship)\n
        \tIf you cannot perform I’tikaaf during the last ten nights it is strongly recommended to spend the actual night of Laylat-ul-Qadr in ibaadah, at the Masjid, reciting dua and seeking repentance as much as you can. As mentioned above, reciting the Holy Qur’an and supplications are recommended, along with reciting tasbih prayers and the recommended amaal for Laylat-ul-Qadr during the course of the night.

    <string name="event6_name">Eid al-Fitr\n</string>
    <string name="event6_hijri_date">1 Shawal,</string>
    <string name="event6_info">
        \tRamadan, the month of fasting, ends with the festival of Eid al-Fitr. Literally the "Festival of Breaking the Fast," Eid al-Fitr is one of the two most important Islamic celebrations (Eid al-Adha is the other). At Eid al-Fitr people dress in their finest clothes, adorn their homes with lights and decorations, give treats to children, and enjoy visits with friends and family.\n\n
        \tA sense of generosity and gratitude colors these festivities. Although charity and good deeds are always important in Islam, they have special significance at the end of Ramadan. As the month draws to a close, Muslims are obligated to share their blessings by feeding the poor and making contributions to mosques.

    <string name="event9_name">Day of \'Arafah</string>
    <string name="event9_hijri_date">9 Dhul Hijjah,</string>
    <string name="event9_info">
        \tThe day of Arafah is also significant because this amazing ayah was revealed on this day:\n
        \t"This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion." (Surah al Maa\'idah 5:3)\n\n
        \tArafah was the Day on which Allah perfected His religion, completed His favours upon His beloved Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), and approved Islam as a way of life!\n\n
        \tThings to Do on the Day of Arafah\n
        \t1. Fasting on the Day of Arafah: \n
        Fasting is highly encouraged and recommended for those not going on hajj.\n
        "Fasting on the Day of Arafah expiates the sins of the past year and the coming year." (Muslim)\n\n
        \t2. DU\'AA OF ARAFAH: Saying this du\'aa very often:\n
        The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said:\n
        "The most excellent dua is the dua on the Day of Arafah, and the best of what I and the prophets before me have said, is "There is nothing that deserves to be worshiped in truth except Allaah, He is Alone and has no partner, to Him belongs the dominion and to Him belongs all praise, and He is All-Powerful over all things." (Muwatta)\n\m
        \t3. Making Tahleel, Takbeer, Tahmeed and Tasbeeh:\n
        Its is a sunnah of our Prophet (pbuh) to recite the Tahleel, Takbeer and Tahmeed as many times as possible on the day of Arafah, and also on the days of Tashreeq (11, 12 and 13th of Dhul Hijjah\n
        Tahleel is to say "Laa ilaaha il-lal-laah"\n
        Takbeer is to say "Allahu Akbar"\n
        Tahmeed is to say "Alhamdulillaah"\n
        Tasbeeh is to say "Subhanallaah".\n
        \t4. Seek forgiveness from Almighty Allah:\n
        The Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said:\n
        "On this day, Allah, the most Exalted, descends to the nearest heaven, and He is proud of His servants on the earth and says to those in heavens, look at My servants, they have come from far and near, with hair disheveled and faces covered with dust, to seek my Mercy. Even if their sins are as much the sand or the froth of the sea, I shall forgive them.

    <string name="event10_hijri_date">10 Dhul Hijjah,</string>
    <string name="event10_info">
        \tAt Eid al-Adha, many Muslims make a special effort to pray and listen to a sermon at a mosque. They also wear new clothes, visit family members and friends and may symbolically sacrifice an animal in an act known as qurbani. This represents the animal that Ibrahim sacrificed in the place of his son.

    <string name="event16_name">Mawlid al-Nabi</string>
    <string name="event16_hijri_date">12 Rabi ul Awwal,</string>
    <string name="event16_info">

This month is considered to be a month of renewal, a time to renew your love for our beloved Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). It is an excellent time to remind ourselves of the significant events that took place and form some good habits.\n\n
        \tRecommended acts\n
        1.Reconnect With Allah swt.Rabi’ al Awwal is a time for renewal; being grateful to Allah swt, reviving our connection with Him and His Messenger by learning more about the Qur’an and Sunnah. It’s a time to be thankful to Allah swt for sending our beloved Prophet (pbuh) to us to guide us to His Light. It is a time for grounding ourselves in our purpose of worshiping Allah swt.\n
        2. Increase Your Salawat/Salutation Upon The Prophet (pbuh). There are numerous such documented benefits of sending salam and blessing to the Prophet (pbuh). When you send salutation to the Prophet (pbuh), you are obeying the command of Allah, Allah returns the salutation ten times, the Prophet(pbuh) hears your greeting, and last but not least you get peace and blessings from the angels.\n
